# Mutli CPU Scheduling

## Simulation

1. Time to complete will be 30 seconds. The only job queued is A.

2. 20 units. When the work set can be set in cache, reused items can be accessed rapidly.

3. With the ```-T``` flag, the time units are decreased by 2 once the item is in cache.

4. Cache warms at time unit 9.

5. The cache is always cleared by the time the process will benefit from it. 2 threads with a total of 300 time units means 150 total execution time.

6. Time will be reduced to 100. The two smaller jobs will share cache with affinity. Actual value is 110 time units.
